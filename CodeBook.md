###Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Training and test sets were merged by rbinding Y-test.txt and Y_train.txt (dataActivity),
subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt (dataSubject), then X_test.txt and X_train.txt (dataFeatures).
- dataSubject was "named" subject, dataActivity "activity"
- dataFeatures was "named" via data in features.txt
- These were all combined horizontally

###Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- I decided to best satisfy the project requirement, to use only columns with "mean()" and
"std()" in the names.
- Ended up with 68 columns.

###Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- I used the factor() function to replace the activity IDs with the human-readable text
held in activity_labels.txt

###Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- Accomplished by replacing the exisiting abbreviations in the column names with the full
terms.

###From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- Using the aggregate function, I took the mean of each variable
- It was then ordered first by activity, then subject
- The data is saved in tidydata.txt which should appear in your working directory.
- A copy is in the repository.

==================================================================

>The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

>The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

>For each record it is provided:
======================================

>- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

>The dataset includes the following files:
